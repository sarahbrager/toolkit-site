intro

### Incorporating the data in your reporting 

If you're a journalist covering Texas politics and policymaking in any way, these statistics could provide great context for readers about the current legislative session. Whether you're doing a broad overview of trends from the session or reporting on a specific bill, you can come back to this analysis and pull information to weave into your article. For example:

#### [Some tips for writing with numbers]{.underline}

-   Don't include more than 2-3 stats in a paragraph.

-   

#### [What if I'm a journalist in a different state?]{.underline} 

You can run this exact analysis using LegiScan data from any other state! Follow the instructions on the Sourcing page, but select your state of choice when downloading the data.
