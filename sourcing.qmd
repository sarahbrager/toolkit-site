### Our data source

All of the data for this tutorial comes from [LegiScan](https://legiscan.com/datasets), a real-time and nonpartisan legislative tracking service available to the public. While this project only focuses on data from the Texas Legislature, LegiScan offers data sets from all 50 states. The data is updated weekly on Sundays.

LegiScan is a good example of the type of public database that a data journalist might pull from frequently. There are lots of other resources available online with data from government agencies. If you're a journalist covering the environment, for example, you might try the [EPA's Open Data Portal](https://www.epa.gov/data). If you're a local government reporter, you might pull public records from your city's database, like the [City of Austin's portal](https://data.austintexas.gov/). And then there are more general community databases, like [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), which lets you filter by topic.

Now let's get into the Texas Lege data!

### Steps for downloading

#### **1. Go to [legiscan.com](https://legiscan.com/datasets)**

#### **2. Create an account**

LegiScan requires you to create a username and password to download datasets. This is completely free. Create an account, and then click on the "Datasets" tab at the top of the page.

::: callout-note
LegiScan will ask you to verify your account before you can download the data. Make sure you do that.

#### **3. Filter for Texas**

Select "TX" to view all of LegiScan's data from the Texas Legislature. You'll see their data goes back to 2010 (the 81st Texas Legislature). For now, we're just going to focus on the 89th session, which is the current one for 2025-2026.

#### **4. Download the CSV file**

In the top right corner of the data library is a column that says "CSV Basic." This is the type of file we want to download.

::: callout-note
CSV stands for "comma separated values," which is just one of many ways a dataset can be stored. This is a pretty common file type for working with data, so if you're ever downloading data from other sources, you'll likely see this as an option.
:::

Click on the red "CSV" button for the 89th session to download the file to your computer. It should be a compressed folder filled with multiple csv files.

::: {.callout-tip title="Tip"}
I recommend immediately renaming the folder to something that makes sense for the topic and is easy to find later on your computer. For example: "**tx-bills-89**"
:::

### Take a look at the data

Open the zip file that was downloaded to your computer and take a look at the different files inside. Notice that you actually get 7 different CSVs when you download from LegiScan. You can see when the data was last updated by looking at the Date Modified column. No need to go through each file now, we'll start looking at those in the next section.

### Add the files to your R project

Go back to your project in posit.cloud and click on the Upload button in the bottom right window.

![](toolkit-pics/upload-data.png)

::: callout-tip
If you're working in the R Studio application, there isn't a little upload button within the R interface. Instead, you can manually move the CSVs to your data-raw folder in Finder (File Explorer if you use a PC).
:::

A little window will pop up asking you to choose the files from your computer. In this tutorial, **we're just going to use three of the CSVs: "bills," "people," and "sponsors**." Add those to your project one at a time:

-   Click on Choose File and select one of the CSVs.

-   Where it says target directory, click on browse and select your data-raw folder (to keep things organized). Hit OK.

-   Do the same thing for the second and third CSV files.

-   Add the README file to your project as well. We'll take a look at that in the next section. No need to add this one to the data-raw folder.

![](toolkit-pics/directory.png)

Now you should see all three datasets inside your data-raw folder when you click on it. Make sure they are actually **inside** the folder; this will prevent errors in the next section of the lesson. To exit out of the folder, click on the two little dots next to the green arrow.

### Recap

In this section, you learned how to download data from LegiScan, view the files on your computer, and upload those files to your R project. These are universal steps you can follow for any data project in posit.cloud/R Studio, so keep this page in mind as a resource.

Now you're ready to start coding! In the next section, we'll look at all of the data provided and "clean it" in R to pick out the specific variables we want to focus on for this project.
