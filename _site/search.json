    "text": "What is data journalism?\nData journalism, or data-driven storytelling, is a form of journalism where reporters/other members of a news organization sift through large data sets to uncover trends or other newsworthy information, and then present those findings to the public in a digestible way. Simply put, it’s telling the stories found in data. In reality, though, data journalism is much more creative and complex. It can take a variety of forms, including:\n\nDesigning visualizations and interactive news graphics to explain numbers (These can often be embedded within news articles.)\nUsing code to quickly sort through large data sets and pull out the most important information\nReporting investigative stories based on findings from a data analysis (You might find something important that’s been completely overlooked!)\nMachine learning and AI engineering for newsrooms (This method is more computer science-oriented.)\n\nExamples of data journalism:",
