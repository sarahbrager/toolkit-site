title: "Making Data Visualizations"
format: html

Now that we've found some key stats from our analysis of legislative bills, we're going to use data to make two different types of visualizations: **a bar chart and a choropleth map.** These are both very common ways of presenting data within news stories because they're engaging, informative and visually pleasing.

For this lesson, you're going to use the table of top bill sponsors that you saved in the previous step to build a bar chart. Then, you'll use the other data set of bills filed per state senator to build the map. These are just two of many possible ways to visualize all the data you have at your fingertips.

### Working in Datawrapper

[Datawrapper](https://www.datawrapper.de/) is a free tool that lets you upload or manually enter data and personalize the visualizations (charts, maps, and tables) with no coding required! It's pretty user-friendly, and it produces clean, professional graphics similar to what you'd see on a news website.

#### [Datawrapper Academy]{.underline}

Datawrapper has a great learning dashboard, called [Datawrapper Academy](https://academy.datawrapper.de/), that walks you through how to design all the different types of visualizations on the website. I *highly* recommend you explore this resource, especially since we're only going to walk through two types of graphics. Bookmark it and return to it the next time you want to build a chart for a news story or some other data project!

#### [Other tools for visualizations]{.underline}

[Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/discover) and [Flourish](https://flourish.studio/) are also popular options for designing charts, but they're a bit more complex in my opinion.

### What you will build

Take a peek at the two finished charts below to get a sense of what you're going to build.

**1. A bar chart of the top 10 bill sponsors from the session:**

```{=html}
<iframe title="Top sponsors in the 89th Texas Legislative Session" aria-label="Bar Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-bVCvf" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/bVCvf/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="476" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";r.style.height=d}}}))}();
</script>
```

**2. An interactive map of Texas senate districts + bills filed per state senator:**

```{=html}
<iframe title="Which Texas senators sponsored the most legislation this session, and who do they represent?Â " aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-59Y00" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/59Y00/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="804" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";r.style.height=d}}}))}();
</script>
```

Click on a district to see the senator's name and the number of bills/joint resolutions they sponsored this session. Also note the zoom feature in the lower right corner.

### Recap

Now you have two beautiful charts to show off! Play around with the other types of charts and maps in Datawrapper on your own. Here are some key things to keep in mind for making data viz for news reporting:

-   Embrace your inner minimalist. Only add color/text/shading when it helps convey important information. If someone takes a look at your chart and immediately feels overwhelmed, they're going to scroll right past it.

-   Be brief but specific with titles. Avoid titles like, "Map of Texas Senate Districts." That doesn't tell the reader anything about the data.

-   Add appropriate context in the description (1-2 sentences). Always include the name and date of the data source.

-   Make things interactive when possible! People love to "play" with graphics.

-   For news charts, use AP Style grammar in your title/description so it's consistent with the rest of the article.

The next section of this toolkit highlights ways to use what you've learned thus far in your actual reporting. You're almost at the end!
