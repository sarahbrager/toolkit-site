Data journalism, or data-driven storytelling, is a form of journalism where reporters/other members of a news organization sift through large data sets to uncover trends or other newsworthy information, and then present those findings to the public in a digestible way. Simply put, it’s telling the stories found in data. In reality, though, data journalism is much more creative and complex. It can take a variety of forms, including:

-   Designing visualizations and interactive news graphics to explain numbers (These can often be embedded within news articles.)
-   Using code to quickly sort through large data sets and pull out the most important information
-   Reporting investigative stories based on findings from a data analysis (You might find something important that’s been completely overlooked!)
-   Machine learning and AI engineering for newsrooms (This method is more computer science-oriented.)
