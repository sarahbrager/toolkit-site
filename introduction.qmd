### What is it?

Data journalism, or data-driven storytelling, is a form of journalism that involves sifting through large data sets to uncover trend and answer questions, and then presenting those findings to the public as you would any other type of newsworthy information. Simply put, it’s telling stories found in data.

Data-driven storytelling can be hard-hitting investigations or fun xyz. There's no one right way of data reporting, and it's always changing as digital tools become more advanced and accessible. Data journalism can take a variety of forms, including:

-   Designing informative and interactive visualizations to embed within news stories
-   Using code to quickly sort through large data sets and pull out the most important information
-   Reporting investigative stories based on findings from a data analysis (You might find something important that’s been completely overlooked!)
-   Machine learning and AI engineering for newsrooms (A more computer science-oriented method)

### Examples of data reporting

Many news publications have specific data departments that focus on investigation, analytics and visualization, including (but not limited to):
